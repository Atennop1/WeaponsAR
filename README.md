## About project

This is my project for 10th grade, which I did in the Altair technology park from RTU MIREA using Unity version 2022.3.12.1f. The project itself is an application in which you can scan weapon tags in augmented reality, and then see what they look like, their history, listen to the sound of a shot, and most importantly, watch a step-by-step guide to assembling this weapon. I did this project trying to adhere to the OOP style, but without composition root it will not be possible to fully develop OOP and I will have to put the logic into MonoBehaviors.

### Specifics
 - Project trying to use **OOP** and **SOLID**
 - My first project with **AR**
 - The first project to be defended before the commission
 - The project was completed in a fairly short time frame
 
### Tools
 - UniTask
 - TextMeshPro
 - Vuforia
 - [Farid's SaveSystem](https://github.com/Farid357/Save-System)
 - [SerializableInterface](https://github.com/Thundernerd/Unity3D-SerializableInterface)
 
 ## Conclusion
 
This project was a fun experience working with AR and Unity, it gave me a greater understanding of how such applications work and allowed me to complete 10th grade without academic debt. Well, I also learned how to assemble an AK-47 :D
